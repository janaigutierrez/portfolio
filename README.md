# Personal Portfolio - Janai Gutierrez

## Project Description

Interactive personal portfolio with a marine theme, built with React and Vite. This project is designed as a quick and functional presentation card to showcase projects and skills, prioritizing utility and development speed over code purity.

> **Important Note**: This portfolio is NOT intended to be an example of perfect code or ideal architecture. Many things are hardcoded or use inline styles to prioritize rapid deployment. The intention is to have a functional base that can be refined over time.
